# Count Letters

# Write a method that will take a string, keep count
# of each letter and return the totals as a hash.

# Example:
# count_letters("hello") should return {"h"=>1, "e"=>1, "l"=>2, "o"=>1}
# count_letters("mississippi") should return {"m"=>1, "i"=>4, "s"=>4, "p"=>2}

# Check your solution by running the tests:
# ruby tests/08_count_letters_test.rb

def count_letters (string)
  result = {} # You'll need an empty hash to get started!
  
  # array = string.split(//)
  # # return result # return the hash
  # array.each {|letter|
  #   next
  #     result[letter] += 1
  #   }
    string.each_char do |letter|
        if result[letter]
            result[letter] += 1
        else
            result[letter] = 1
        end
    end  
    result.sort_by {|letter, count| count}
    p result
  end
  count_letters("mississippi")
